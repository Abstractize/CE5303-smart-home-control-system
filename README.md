# 🏡 Smart Home Control System – CE5303 Project

This project was developed for the university course **CE5303 – Embedded Systems**. It implements a smart home control platform using a **custom Linux image** (built with **Yocto**) on a **Raspberry Pi**, a **.NET Core API**, and a **React Native mobile app**. Users can monitor and control smart devices in real time.
